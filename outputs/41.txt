### Building a GPT-4 Tokenizer

In the journey to build your own GPT-4 tokenizer, there are a series of steps that you could follow to understand and implement the tokenization process. Tokenization is critical because it converts raw text into a format that a language model like GPT-4 can understandâ€”namely, a series of tokens.

#### Step 1: Basic Tokenizer

First, you need to create a basic tokenizer that can handle essential functions like training on text data, encoding text into tokens, and decoding tokens back into text. Here's a simple structure for the tokenizer:

- `def train(self, text, vocab_size, verbose=False)`: Train the tokenizer on the provided text data up to the specified vocabulary size.
- `def encode(self, text)`: Convert text into a sequence of tokens.
- `def decode(self, ids)`: Translate a sequence of tokens back into human-readable text.

Training your tokenizer on a specific text will allow you to create a vocabulary tailored to the content and nuances of that text. One suggested test text for this is the Wikipedia page of Taylor Swift, as it's lengthy and provides a rich vocabulary to work with.

#### Step 2: Advanced Tokenizer with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

After crafting a basic tokenizer, the next step involves advancing to a Regex-based tokenizer and merging it with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). BPE is commonly used in natural language processing to efficiently tokenize text based on the frequency of character pairs. Here's a high-level explanation of creating a tokenizer using BPE:

```python
# Example code for building a BPE tokenizer
import tiktoken

# Obtain the base encoding using the BPE tokenizer
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("c1l00k_base") # GPT-4 tokenizer
print(enc.encode("ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš” ðŸŒž (hello in Korean!)"))
print(enc.decode(enc.encode("ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš” ðŸŒž (hello in Korean!)")) == "ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš” ðŸŒž (hello in Korean!)")
```

This code demonstrates encoding and decoding using a BPE tokenizer. You would be replacing `"c1l00k_base"` with your own trained model reference.

#### BPE Visual Representation

When visualizing Byte Pair Encoding, you think about how tokens are merged. In the GPT-4 case, for example, the first merge during training was two spaces into a single token. Such visual representations help understand the order and the manner of token merges that occurred during the training of the model.

#### Step 3: Customize and Train Your Tokenizer

After understanding the underlying principles of a BPE tokenizer, you can move on to customizing and training your own tokenizer based on your specific requirements. Tiktoken library does not come with a training function, but you can implement your own train function by referencing existing code in repositories like MBP (minbpe).

Here's an example of how the code might look for training and visualizing token vocabularies:

```python
# Example code for training tokenizer and viewing token vocabularies
# ... (training code) ...

# Visualizing token vocabularies
bpe_tokens = minbpe.train(...)
print(bpe_tokens)
```

You would need to replace the training code with your own logic to train the tokenizer on your dataset.

#### Exercise Progression and References

Throughout the process, you can follow the exercise progression laid out in the MBP repository's `exercise.md` file. It breaks down the task into manageable steps, guiding you through the process. Additionally, tests and code within the repository can be referenced whenever you feel stuck or need clarification.

> Code examples and tests can be found in the repository to assist in creating your own GPT-4 tokenizer.

#### Visual Aids in Repository

The images from the video show different screens of the repository and the exercise itself. One screenshot shows the `README.md` and various files, highlighting the minimal, clean code for the BPE algorithm used in LLM tokenization. Another image provides a glimpse of the `exercise.md` file content, specifying instructions for building your own GPT-4 Tokenizer.

Please note that the specifics of the code and the tokenizer are dependent on each individual's implementation and the specific dataset used for training. The above explanation serves as a guide to understanding the process and identifying the necessary components for constructing a tokenizer for your own use.
