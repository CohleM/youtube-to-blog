### Understanding Tokenization with SentencePiece

Tokenization is a fundamental step in processing natural language for machine learning models. It involves breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. I've been experimenting with a tokenization library called SentencePiece, and I'd like to share my findings and what I've learned from applying it to various texts, including those with characters outside of its training set.

#### Encoding with SentencePiece and Out-of-Vocabulary Characters

First off, SentencePiece can tokenize text into tokens and assign each token an ID. These IDs represent the different pieces of text (words or subwords), which a model can process further. While tokenizing English text worked seamlessly, something interesting happened when I included Korean characters:

```python
ids = sp.encode("hello 안녕하세요!")
print(ids)
# [362, 378, 361, 372, 358, 362, 239, 152, 139, 238, 136, 152, 240, 152, 155, 239, 135, 187, 239, 157, 151]
```

Since the Korean characters weren't part of the training set for the SentencePiece model, it encountered unfamiliar code points. Ordinarily, without a corresponding token, these characters would be unidentified (unknown tokens). However, since I set `byte_fallback` to `true`, the library didn't stop at the unknown tokens. Instead, it defaulted to encoding these characters in UTF-8 bytes, representing each byte with a special token in the vocabulary.

> **Note**: The UTF-8 encoding results in a sequence that is shifted due to the special tokens assigned earlier ID numbers.

#### The Impact of byte_fallback Setting

Curiosity led me to toggle the `byte_fallback` flag to `false`. By doing so, lengthy merges occurred because we weren't occupying the vocabulary space with byte-level tokens anymore. When re-encoding the same text:

```python
# With byte_fallback set to False
ids = sp.encode("hello 안녕하세요!")
print(ids)
# [0] - with byte_fallback false, unknown characters map to the <unk> token, ID 0
```

The entire string was mapped to a single `<unk>` token, ID 0. It's important to understand that this `<unk>` token would feed into a language model. The language model might struggle with this because it means that various rare or unrecognized elements get lumped together, a property we typically want to avoid.

#### Decoding Individual Tokens and Spaces

While decoding individual tokens, SentencePiece showed that spaces turn into a specific token denoted by bold underline in their system. This is important to note as spaces are a significant element in tokenization and must be accounted for appropriately in the encoded sequence.

#### Visualizing the Tokenization Process

Looking at the screenshots provided, it's clear how SentencePiece tokenizes and encodes the input text into tokens and how toggling certain settings can drastically change the outcome of this process.

By sharing this experiment, my aim is to demystify the tokenization step and the intricacies involved when dealing with various languages and character sets. SentencePiece is a powerful tool that offers flexibility and a nuanced approach to handling out-of-vocabulary characters, which is crucial for building robust language models.
